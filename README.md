Yii-blueprint
=============

Boilerplate code for multi-device,url-friendly,Complete ajax web 2.0 apps.
It uses bootstrap and jquery ui widgets with lazy loading using Yiibooster. It is also completely ajax enabled. Some core files have been changed a bit (nothing to worry about). It is also url-friendly using html5 pushstate and a .htaccess file in the root directory.

Used libraries:
Twitter Bootstrap
Jquery UI               (Lazy loading)
Bootstrap widgets       (Lazy loading)
Jquery Bbq              (Deprecated)

Future Plans:
Independant of jquery Bbq.
Lighter start.
